GPU-enabled Torch (preferred) and TfLite backend spport.
Targeting WasiNN section (plugins/wasi_nn), we made various implementations to enable ML inference to support GPU accerlation, focusing on the WasiNN portion (plugins/wasi_nn). 

TfLite still has compatibility issues, and it frequently malfunctions when used with  GPU delegete. and we are waiting for the solutions.
